Circletap project is a patatap (https://patatap.com/) clone. The project is not so complete as patatap but it works similarly. When a keyboard letter is pressed a colorful circle appears its radius is continuously decreased until it disappears. Along with that process, a specific sound is played. Both the circle color and the sound will be different according to the pressed key.

To build this project were used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, paper.js and howler.js, which are JavaScript libraries to deal with graphics and sound respectively.
